The description below is taken from Kaggle competition [page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/commonlitreadabilityprize)

CommonLit, Inc., is a nonprofit education technology organization serving over 20 million teachers and students with free digital reading and writing lessons for grades 3-12. Together with Georgia State University, an R1 public research university in Atlanta, they are challenging Kagglers to improve readability rating methods.

In this competition, youâ€™ll build algorithms to rate the complexity of reading passages for grade 3-12 classroom use. To accomplish this, you'll pair your machine learning skills with a dataset that includes readers from a wide variety of age groups and a large collection of texts taken from various domains. Winning models will be sure to incorporate text cohesion and semantics. 


## :man_technologist: How to use <a name="how-to-use"/>
In order to use this project, you have to follow passages written in [setup](#setup) and then it's recommended to change runtime in Runtime -> Change runtime modifying None in GPU. The project is divided in different section, one for all the step (libraries import, dataset preprocessing ecc...). 





## :gear: Setup <a name="setup"/>
To run this project, you can use Google Colab and upload the file, here is the [link](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb?utm_source=scs-index).
For this project we have used Google Drive to store dataset, so in order to run it properly you have to download dataset from Kaggle competition at this [page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/commonlitreadabilityprize/data) and then link your own content drive. 

We have also used another dataset which is AoA (Age-of-acquisition), this is the [website](http://crr.ugent.be/archives/806) and you download it [here](http://crr.ugent.be/papers/AoA_51715_words.zip).
